listmusik
=========

A simple music organiser for DJs

Listmusik allows you to manage a library of tracks and playlists.  Library data
can be imported from applications such as iTunes, Traktor, and Rekordbox, or
from M3U playlist files.

You can create playlists as well as search, filter, and organise them for total
control of your track selection experience.  The playlists can then be exported
to a variety of formats for use with other systems.

Features
--------

Listmusik offers a wide range of features for DJs

  - Import data from Traktor collections, Rekordbox xml files, and M3U playlists.
  - Rearrange, filter, combine, and edit playlists to suit your needs.

An essential part of playing a set is having access to your tunes, whatever the
available equipment may be.

Laptop DJs
----------
  - To use with Traktor or Rekordbox performance mode, listmusik can export your
    library in the NML and Rekordbox XML formats.
  - From Rekordbox you can also use 'Link Export' to view the library on
    connected CDJ and XDJ players.

USB DJs
-------
  - To use with Pioneer CDJs and XDJs, export your listmusik library to the
    Rekordbox xml format.  Then use the Rekordbox application to export the
    playlists to an external device such as a USB drive or SD card.
  - If you want to avoid Rekordbox, listmusik can also copy playlists to
    external devices in M3U format.  For example, you can copy your main music
    folder to a USB drive and have listmusik copy your playlists over too, for
    browsing on another computer or CDJ.
  - The ultimate solution is to use Rekorbox to export to a USB, and have
    listmusik copy over your playlists in an M3U format for Rekordbox devices.
    Then with one USB drive you're ready to DJ on almost any hardware, from the
    industry standard CDJs to your mate's laptop.
